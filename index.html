<p>
    Welcome to my personal website. 
</p>

<p>
    I am scientist working on information systems.
</p>
<p>
    I have academic degrees in experimental psychology (B.A., 1996, M.A., 1999, <a href = "html/institutions/Belgium/UCLouvain/index.html">UCLouvain</a>), statistics (M.S., 2000, <a href = "html/institutions/Belgium/UCLouvain/index.html">UCLouvain</a>),  artificial intelligence (M.S., 2004, <a href = "html/institutions/Belgium/KULeuven/index.html">KU Leuven</a>) and cognitive science (Ph.D., 2009, <a href = "html/institutions/USA/UofM/index.html">University of Memphis</a>).
</p>

<p>
    I have been a researcher at <a href = "html/institutions/Belgium/UCLouvain/index.html">UCLouvain</a>, <a href = "html/institutions/Belgium/KULeuven/index.html">KU Leuven</a>, <a href = "html/institutions/USA/UofM/index.html">University of Memphis</a>, <a href = "html/institutions/Canada/ULaval/index.html">Laval University</a>, and <a href = "html/institutions/Italy/UniPi/index.html">University of Pisa</a>. At the moment I am a researcher at the National Institute for Criminalistics and Criminology (<a href = "html/institutions/Belgium/NICC/index.html">NICC</a>), and a teaching assistant at <a href = "html/institutions/Belgium/UCLouvain/index.html">UCLouvain</a>.
</p>


<p>
    I am the designer and developer of the <a href = "html/miscellaneous/I/IHD/index.html">Integrated Historical Database (IHD)</a>, a computer system created to store datasets extracted from different sources, and facilitate their preservation and exploitation.
</p>  

<p>
    Research projects I am working on are <a href = "html/projects/FAR/index.html">FAR</a>, <a href = "html/projects/IIHA/index.html">IIHA</a>, <a href = "html/projects/REGUIDE/index.html">REGUIDE</a>, <a href = "html/projects/DOT/index.html">DOT</a>, and <a href = "html/projects/MJE/index.html">MJE</a>.
</p>


<p>
    In general, I am interested by science and humanities, and in doing so I rely a lot on <a href = "html/miscellaneous/C/Computer Science/index.html">computers</a>. Topics of particular interests to me are <a href = "html/miscellaneous/P/Python/index.html">Python</a> programming and <a href = "html/miscellaneous/G/Graphs/index.html">graphs</a>. I love reflecting on ideas and reading <a href = "html/miscellaneous/B/books/index.html">books</a>, and I developed a passion for the work of several authors (e.g., <a href = "html/miscellaneous/E/Erasmus/index.html">Erasmus</a>, <a href = "html/miscellaneous/R/Bertrand_Russell/index.html">Bertrand Russell</a>).
</p>

<p>
    This website is updated regularly. I use it to organize my ideas and resources in a totally transparent way. On it, you'll find the <a href = "html/projects/index.html">projects</a> and <a href = "html/publications/index.html">publications</a> I took part in, the <a href = "html/events/index.html">events</a> in which I may have been involved, and the <a href = "html/institutions/index.html">institutions</a> that supported me in these endeavours. The <a href = "html/miscellaneous/index.html">miscellaneous</a> section contains an array of subjects that interest me or that pertain to me, and that I could not place in the other sections.
</p>

    Please feel free to <a href = "html/contact.html">contact</a> me.
